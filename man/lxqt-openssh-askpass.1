The \fBLXQt modules\fR are desktop independent tools, 
and operate as daemons for the local user for desktop-specific operations.

\fBLXQt\fR is an advanced, easy-to-use, and fast desktop environment based on Qt
technologies, ships several core desktop components, all of which are optional:
.P
 * Panel
 * Desktop
 * Application launcher
 * Settings center
 * Session handler
 * Polkit handler
 * SSH password access \fI(this)\fR
 * Display manager handler

These components perform similar actions to those available in other desktop
environments, and their names are self-descriptive.  They are usually not launched
by hand but automatically, when choosing a \fBLXQt\fR session in the Display
Manager.

that asks for the user's key needed for access over another machine host.

by the \fBlxqt\-settings\fR application as \fISSH_ASKPASS=\fR 
with \fBlxqt\-openssh\-askpass\fR value, openssl and openssh-client packages must be required.
